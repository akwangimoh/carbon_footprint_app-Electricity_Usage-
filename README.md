Carbon Footprint App is an interactive tool that helps individuals and organizations measure the carbon emissions generated by their electricity consumption. 
Users input their electricity usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and the corresponding month, 
and the app calculates the associated CO₂ emissions. 
The project aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of electricity use, 
encouraging energy-saving habits and informed decisions. 
By visualizing personal or organizational emissions, users can track reductions over time, 
contributing to the global effort to limit climate change.

Aligned with the Paris Agreement, the app emphasizes the importance of keeping global warming below 1.5°C 
by empowering individuals to understand and reduce their carbon footprint. This project bridges data, sustainability, 
and technology to promote actionable climate solutions at the grassroots level.
